<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Siim Suurkask. I work as a sound technician in one of the most recognised showproduction and rentalservice companies in Estonia - RGB Baltic. 
  I have been working there for more than a decade. It's a tricky job, but there seems to be somekind of a force that drives me and my colleagues 
  to keep pushing and give maximum effort and keep the gigs running. 
</p>

<p>I also have a wonderful family with 3 beautiful kids and a lovely wife. I really do consider myself to be a real familyman.
  My family is my number one priority they are the ones that keep me motivated.

<p>I have picked up several hobbies. I do quite a bit of music. I have been singing since I was a little boy.
  I had pidano lessons for about 10 years but I think main instrument today is guitar. 
  Whenever I play an instrument, sing or listen to music, I can feel the stress flowing out of me. It really is a relief
  I also have the same kind of feeling when I'm fiddling around with my photo camera or doing some sports.
  My latest crush has been Fujifilm hybrid camera x-t30. It looks retro, but actually is pretty modern. 
  Exercising keeps my head clear. Although it's harder to find time for myself to do some sports, I never say no to football, 
  being it with my kids at home or adults in sunday league
