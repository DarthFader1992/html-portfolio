<h1>The Best Movies According to Siim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>I like mind games. It's a Martin Scoresese movie. Also I haven't seen a bad movie where Leonardo DiCaprio has been picked as an actor.</p>
<h3>A Christmas Story</h3>
<p>This movie was made in 1983. I found this masterpiece when I was already an adult. It really gets me in the christmas mood. Can't wait for my children to learn enough english to get the jokes in it.</p>
<h3>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h3>
<p>The cartoon I recently watched with my younger son in the movies. As a Mario fan from past, I was entertained.</p>
